# ReRAM-defect-detection-using-AutoEncoders
Exploring the use of autoencoders for detecting ReRAM faults, as memristor is a emerging technology and suffers from many defects even though it offers superior density and less area overhead as compared to SRAMs.

Synthetic data has been used for the simulations

Consider a simple case of os using the MNIST dataset with 784 inputs mapped to 392 outputs.
